# EBC-A20 Frame Reference

This document describes the binary protocol used by ZKETECH EBC battery testers.
It was reverse engineered from USB traffic captures. A useful starting point for
the initial investigation was this blog post, though it is incomplete and contains
some inaccuracies: <https://pop.fsck.pl/hardware/zketech-ebc-a20.html>

The device communicates over a **CH340 USB-serial adapter** (VID `0x1A86`,
PID `0x7523`) at **9600 baud, 8E1** (8 data bits, even parity, 1 stop bit).
There is no USB HID or custom USB class involved. It is plain serial over USB.
Note that the parity is **even (E)**, not the more common none (8N1). Using the wrong parity setting will result in garbled or no communication.

Some fields remain unknown and are noted as such.

## Frame structure

Every message in both directions uses the same wrapper:

```text
[0xfa] [payload...] [checksum] [0xf8]
```

| Byte(s) | Role | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First byte | Start of frame (SOF) | Always `0xfa` |
| Middle bytes | Payload | Command-specific |
| Second-to-last byte | Checksum | XOR of all payload bytes |
| Last byte | End of frame (EOF) | Always `0xf8` |

- **Host → device** frames are always **10 bytes** (7-byte payload).
- **Device → host** frames are always **19 bytes** (16-byte payload).

### Checksum

The checksum is computed by XOR-ing every payload byte together (not including
the SOF, EOF, or the checksum byte itself):

```text
checksum = payload[0] ^ payload[1] ^ payload[2] ^ ... ^ payload[N]
```

**Example:** Connect command `fa 05 00 00 00 00 00 00 05 f8`:

```text
payload  = [0x05, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]
checksum = 0x05 ^ 0x00 ^ 0x00 ^ 0x00 ^ 0x00 ^ 0x00 ^ 0x00 = 0x05  ✓
```

**Example:** CC discharge 200 mA, 3.3 V cutoff `fa 01 00 14 01 5a 00 00 4b f8`:

```text
payload  = [0x01, 0x00, 0x14, 0x01, 0x5a, 0x00, 0x00]
checksum = 0x01 ^ 0x00 ^ 0x14 ^ 0x01 ^ 0x5a ^ 0x00 ^ 0x00 = 0x4b  ✓
```

## Base240 encoding

Numeric values that could be larger than one byte are encoded across two bytes
using base-240. This guarantees neither byte ever equals `0xfa` or `0xf8`,
which are reserved as SOF and EOF markers.

```text
encoded_high = value / 240
encoded_low  = value % 240

value = encoded_high * 240 + encoded_low
```

Both result bytes are always ≤ `0xef` (239), safely below the framing bytes.

**Encoding 200 mA as a current field:**

```text
1. Scale:       200 mA ÷ 10 = 20          (current fields are stored as mA÷10)
2. High byte:   20 / 240 = 0   → 0x00     (how many full groups of 240)
3. Low byte:    20 % 240 = 20  → 0x14     (remainder)
4. Wire bytes:  00 14
```

**Decoding `01 5a` back to a voltage:**

```text
1. High byte:   0x01 = 1
2. Low byte:    0x5a = 90
3. Value:       1 × 240 + 90 = 330          (reverse the base240 formula)
4. Scale:       330 × 10 = 3300 mV = 3.3 V  (voltage fields are stored as mV÷10)
```

### Value scaling

Most numeric fields are scaled before encoding to keep values in a usable
range:

| Field type | Scaling | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current | mA ÷ 10 | 2000 mA → encode 200 |
| Voltage | mV ÷ 10 | 4200 mV → encode 420 |
| Power | W (no scaling) | 5 W → encode 5 |
| Time | minutes (no scaling) | 90 min → encode 90 |
| Calibration values | full mV or mA | 1000 mV → encode 1000 |

## Typical session flow

The device streams status reports continuously as long as it has power —
it does not wait to be asked. The report type changes to reflect whatever the
device is currently doing.

When the PC first connects, the device sends both the firmware report and the
normal mode-specific status report interleaved for approximately 15 seconds, then
stops sending the firmware report and continues with only the mode-specific report.

A typical CC discharge session:

```text
host → fa 05 00 00 00 00 00 00 05 f8    Connect (device LCD shows '-PC-')
dev  → fa 64/65/66/6e/6f/70 ...         Firmware report  ┐ interleaved for ~15 s,
dev  → fa 00/01/02 ...                  Idle report      ┘ then
dev  → fa 00/01/02 ...                  Idle report only (firmware report stops)
host → fa 01 00 14 01 5a 00 00 4b f8    Start CC discharge: 200 mA, 3.3 V cutoff
dev  → fa 0a ...                        CC active report (live current/voltage/mAh)
dev  → fa 0a ...                        CC active report (repeats ~10×/sec)
host → fa 0a 00 01 00 00 00 00 0b f8    Timer sync after 1 minute
dev  → fa 0a ...                        CC active report continues
...
dev  → fa 14 ...                        CC finished (cutoff voltage reached)
dev  → fa 14 ...                        Finished report continues until stopped
host → fa 06 00 00 00 00 00 00 06 f8    Disconnect
```

Key points:

- Reports never stop. The device always streams and the report type just changes
- The host knows an operation finished when the cmd byte changes to the
  "finished" value (e.g. `0x14` for CC discharge)
- If the user stops early, the host sends Stop (`0x02`), which switches the
  device back to sending idle reports

## Outbound frames (host → device)

The host sends 10-byte command frames. The device does not send an explicit
acknowledgement. It responds by changing its behaviour and sending updated status reports.

Every outbound frame has the same structure: the **first payload byte is the
command byte**, which tells the device what to do. The remaining six payload
bytes carry parameters specific to that command. Parameters that are not used
by a particular command are always `0x00`.

For example, Connect has no parameters so all six parameter bytes are zero:

```text
[fa] [05] [00] [00] [00] [00] [00] [00] [05] [f8]
      ↑   └───────────────────────────┘
  command          parameters
```

A CC discharge command uses all six parameter bytes to carry current, cutoff
voltage, and time limit:

```text
[fa] [01] [cur_h] [cur_l] [v_h] [v_l] [t_h] [t_l] [checksum] [f8]
      ↑   └─────────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘
  command     current      cutoff V    time limit
```

### `0x05` Connect

Opens a session with the device. While connected, the LCD shows `'-PC-'`
indicating the device is under PC control.

```text
fa 05 00 00 00 00 00 00 05 f8
```

### `0x06` Disconnect

Ends the session. Clears `'-PC-'` from the LCD and returns the device to
standalone operation.

```text
fa 06 00 00 00 00 00 00 06 f8
```

### `0x02` Stop

Stops any ongoing operation (discharge or charge). The device returns to idle.

```text
fa 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 02 f8
```

### `0x01` Start Constant Current Discharge

Begin discharging a battery at a fixed current until a cutoff condition is met.
The device draws the set current from the battery and stops when either the
battery voltage drops to the cutoff voltage (battery is considered discharged)
or the elapsed time reaches the time limit. Setting the time limit to 0 disables
it. Only the cutoff voltage then terminates the discharge.

```text
[fa] [01] [current_h] [current_l] [cutoff_v_h] [cutoff_v_l] [time_h] [time_l] [checksum] [f8]
```

| Field | Encoding | Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `current` | mA ÷ 10, base240 | 10–20000 mA |
| `cutoff_v` | mV ÷ 10, base240 | 10–30000 mV |
| `time` | minutes, base240 (0 = no limit) | 0–999 min |

```text
200 mA, 3.3 V cutoff, no time limit → fa 01 00 14 01 5a 00 00 4b f8
```

### `0x07` Adjust Constant Current Discharge

Change the discharge current while a CC discharge is already running. The
device adjusts the current immediately without interrupting the session. The capacity accumulator and elapsed timer keep running. Useful for stepping the
current down as the battery voltage falls. Same payload layout as `0x01`.

```text
200 mA, 3.3 V cutoff, no time limit → fa 07 00 14 01 5a 00 00 48 f8
```

### `0x08` Continue Constant Current Discharge

Continue a previously stopped CC discharge session. The device continues from
where it left off. Same payload layout as `0x01`.

```text
100 mA, 3.3 V cutoff, no time limit → fa 08 00 0a 01 5a 00 00 59 f8
```

### `0x11` Start Constant Power Discharge

Begin discharging at a fixed power level. Unlike CC mode, the device
continuously adjusts the drawn current as the battery voltage drops so that
`P = V × I` stays constant. This gives a more realistic load profile for
batteries that are sensitive to power draw rather than current.

```text
[fa] [11] [power_h] [power_l] [cutoff_v_h] [cutoff_v_l] [time_h] [time_l] [checksum] [f8]
```

| Field | Encoding | Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `power` | W, base240 | 1–999 W |
| `cutoff_v` | mV ÷ 10, base240 | 10–30000 mV |
| `time` | minutes, base240 (0 = no limit) | 0–999 min |

### `0x18` Continue Constant Power Discharge

Continue a previously stopped CP discharge session. Same payload layout as `0x11`.

```text
1 W, 3.3 V cutoff, no time limit → fa 18 00 01 01 5a 00 00 42 f8
```

### `0x21` Start Constant Voltage Charge

Begin charging a battery at a target voltage. This implements the standard
CC/CV charging profile used for lithium batteries: the device initially charges
at the set current (CC phase), and as the battery voltage rises toward the
target, the current naturally tapers off (CV phase). Charging stops when the
current falls below the cutoff threshold, which indicates the battery is full.

```text
[fa] [21] [current_h] [current_l] [voltage_h] [voltage_l] [cutoff_i_h] [cutoff_i_l] [checksum] [f8]
```

| Field | Encoding | Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `current` | mA ÷ 10, base240 | 10–5000 mA |
| `voltage` | mV ÷ 10, base240 | 10–30000 mV |
| `cutoff_i` | mA ÷ 10, base240 | 10–9990 mA |

### `0x28` Continue Constant Voltage Charge

Continue a previously stopped CV charge session. Same payload layout as `0x21`.

```text
3 A, 4.2 V, 0.1 A cutoff → fa 28 01 3c 01 b4 00 0a aa f8
```

### `0x0A` Timer sync

Observed to be sent once per minute during active charge or discharge
operations. Bytes 3–4 carry a base240-encoded minute counter starting from 1.
The exact purpose is not confirmed. It may synchronise the device's internal
timer, drive the elapsed-time display, or serve as a keep-alive. The device
does not send a dedicated reply beyond its normal periodic status reports. No
capture in this repository establishes whether omitting, delaying, or resetting
this command changes cutoff behavior. The host therefore sends it only during
an uninterrupted, confirmed host-owned run. The current encoder stops after
57,839 minutes; its use of high byte `0xf0` for the final 240 values has not
been validated on hardware.

```text
[fa] [0a] [minutes_h] [minutes_l] [00] [00] [00] [00] [checksum] [f8]
```

```text
1 min → fa 0a 00 01 00 00 00 00 0b f8
2 min → fa 0a 00 02 00 00 00 00 08 f8
3 min → fa 0a 00 03 00 00 00 00 09 f8
```

### `0x09` Internal resistance test

Triggers a brief discharge pulse at the specified current. The device measures
the battery voltage under load and replies with a single status report of
whichever discharge mode was last active (constant current or constant power).
The host computes internal resistance by comparing the open-circuit voltage
from the most recent prior report to the loaded voltage in this reply:
`R (mΩ) = (V_open − V_loaded) / I`.

```text
[fa] [09] [current_h] [current_l] [00] [00] [00] [00] [checksum] [f8]
```

| Current | Frame |
| --- | --- |
| 200 mA | `fa 09 00 14 00 00 00 00 1d f8` |
| 1000 mA | `fa 09 00 64 00 00 00 00 6d f8` |
| 2000 mA | `fa 09 00 c8 00 00 00 00 c1 f8` |

### `0x04` Calibration

Sets the voltage and current calibration reference points stored on the device.
To calibrate, apply a stable known reference (e.g. a precision power supply) to
the device input, then send the corresponding sub-command with the actual
reference value. According to the manual, the intended voltage reference points
are **1 V** (low) and **4 V** (high).

Each reference value is sent to the device individually (sub-commands `0x00`–`0x03`).
These writes are stored in device RAM only — they take effect immediately but are
lost on the next power cycle. Sub-command `0x04` (Confirm) must be sent to commit
all four values to non-volatile device storage. Closing the dialog without sending
`0x04` leaves the values active until the device is power-cycled, after which the
previous calibration is restored.

```text
[fa] [04] [sub] [value_h] [value_l] [00] [00] [00] [checksum] [f8]
```

Values are in **full mV or mA** (not divided by 10), base240-encoded.

| `sub` | Operation |
| --- | --- |
| `0x00` | Set low voltage reference (mV) |
| `0x01` | Set high voltage reference (mV) |
| `0x02` | Set low current reference (mA) |
| `0x03` | Set high current reference (mA) |
| `0x04` | Confirm — write all four values to device storage |

```text
Low voltage  3747 mV → fa 04 00 0f 93 00 00 00 98 f8
High voltage 3758 mV → fa 04 01 0f 9e 00 00 00 94 f8
Low current  3000 mA → fa 04 02 0c 78 00 00 00 72 f8
High current 3001 mA → fa 04 03 0c 79 00 00 00 72 f8
Confirm              → fa 04 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 f8
```

*(The 3747/3758 mV values above were captured from a test session using a
battery rather than a precision reference, not a proper calibration.)*

## Inbound frames (device → host)

The device sends 19-byte status reports periodically without being asked. The host just has to keep reading. Which report type is sent depends on the current
operating mode.

The **first payload byte is the command byte**, and it encodes two things at
once: the operating mode (CC discharge, CP discharge, or CV charge) and the
current state of that mode. Each mode has three states:

- **Idle**: the mode was last used but is not currently running
- **Active**: the mode is running right now
- **Finished**: the operation ended because a cutoff condition was met (voltage,
  current, or time limit)

The host uses the command byte to update the UI, show the correct measurements,
and know when to stop the elapsed timer. The remaining payload bytes carry the
live measurements (current, voltage, capacity) plus the parameters the device is
operating with (so the host always knows what settings are active).

### Firmware report

Sent for approximately 15 seconds immediately after the device connects to the PC,
regardless of the current operating mode. It carries the firmware version string
and two unknown constant values whose meaning has not been determined. After
those initial seconds the device switches to the mode-specific reports below and
does not send firmware reports again until the next connection.

| Cmd byte | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0x64` | Last mode was CC discharge |
| `0x65` | Last mode was CP discharge |
| `0x66` | Last mode was CV charge |
| `0x6E` | Active — CC discharge |
| `0x6F` | Active — CP discharge |
| `0x70` | Active — CV charge |

### Constant current discharge report

Sent continuously while CC discharge is the active mode (regardless of whether
it is currently running, stopped, or has finished). The payload carries the
live battery measurements in bytes 1–6 and the configured discharge parameters
in bytes 9–14, so the host always has both the current readings and the settings
in every frame.

All inbound frames are 19 bytes: `[fa] [payload × 16] [chk] [f8]`.

| Cmd byte(s) | Report type | P1–P2 | P3–P4 | P5–P6 | P7–P8 | P9–P10 | P11–P12 | P13–P14 | P15 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `64`/`65`/`66`/`6e`/`6f`/`70` | Firmware | cur | volt | mAh | ? | fw ver | ? | ? | dev |
| `00`/`0a`/`14` | CC discharge | cur | volt | mAh | ? | set cur | cutoff V | cutoff t | dev |
| `01`/`0b`/`15` | CP discharge | cur | volt | mAh | ? | set pw | cutoff V | cutoff t | dev |
| `02`/`0c`/`16` | CV charge | cur | volt | mAh | ? | set cur | set V | cutoff I | dev |

**Field key:**

- `cur`: current (base240 × 10 → mA)
- `volt`: voltage (base240 → mV)
- `mAh`: capacity (base240 → mAh)
- `fw ver`: firmware version (base240, e.g. 302 → "3.0.2")
- `set pw`: set discharge power (base240 → W)
- `cutoff t`: cutoff time (base240 → minutes)
- `dev`: device type code (raw byte)
- `?`: unknown, always 0 in observed frames except firmware report P11–P14 (constants 2988 and 2087, meaning unknown)

**Command bytes by mode:**

Each mode has three states. Idle means the mode was last used but nothing is
running. Active means an operation is in progress. Finished means the device
stopped on its own because a cutoff condition was met.

| Mode | Idle | Active | Finished |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CC discharge | `00` | `0a` | `14` |
| CP discharge | `01` | `0b` | `15` |
| CV charge | `02` | `0c` | `16` |

**Firmware report command bytes:**

The firmware report uses a separate set of command bytes that encode which mode
was active at the time the PC connected. There is no "finished" state for
firmware reports.

| Cmd byte | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `64` | Idle or finished — last mode was CC discharge |
| `65` | Idle or finished — last mode was CP discharge |
| `66` | Idle or finished — last mode was CV charge |
| `6e` | Active — CC discharge running |
| `6f` | Active — CP discharge running |
| `70` | Active — CV charge running |
